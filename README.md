# Image Enhancement Algorithms
This repository contains Python code for implementing various image enhancement algorithms using the Tkinter GUI library. 

It includes an implementation of the following: 

### Linear Mapping
Linear mapping is a simple image enhancement technique that stretches the pixel values of an image to a desired range. It is often used to improve the contrast and brightness of an image.

### Digital Negative

### Histogram Stretch & Shrink

### Dependencies
Python 3.x
Tkinter
NumPy
Pillow (PIL)
